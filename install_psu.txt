1) Install the Ximera documentclass.

I guess you have already done that. If not, go to https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex, clone it and move it to a place where your tex distribution can find it (on linux, I have it under ~/texmf/tex/latex)

2) Install xake

They have packages for debian based linux distributions now: https://github.com/XimeraProject/xake/blob/master/docs/install.md

3) Install gpg: If it is not on your system already, sudo apt-get install gnupg2 should do it.

4) Generate a key:

gpg --gen-key

DO NOT PASSWORD PROTECT THE KEY (even though gpg complains). That cost me a lot of time to figure out. This will generate a public and a private key.

gpg --list-keys 

will show the keys on your system. Copy the the public key id (in "2048R/XXXXXXXX", this will be the "XXXXXXXX" part).


5) Send the key to our server: 

gpg --keyserver hkps://ximera.vmhost.psu.edu/ --send-key XXXXXXXX

6) Create your activity. You can follow the section "Setting up a course" in the attached PDF. But I suggest you create a repository on github.com first and then clone it on your computer.  (Otherwise "git push" will give you an error later.)

Once you are done, run "xake bake" and "xake frost" in the directory for your course.

7) Run

xake -U https://ximera.vmhost.psu.edu -k YOUR-GPG-KEY-ID name <name of your repository>

This creates the repository on the server.

8) Run 

xake  -U https://ximera.vmhost.psu.edu serve

9) If everything works, the course should be at https://ximera.vmhost.psu.edu/<name of repository>
